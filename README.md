# Leverenz Portfolio

I will use this website to showcase my work to potential employers.

## Description

When a user opens the page they are presented with the my name, and links to sections about me, their work, and how to contact them.

When a user clicks one of the links in the navigation the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

When a user clicks on the link to the section about my work the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications.

When a user is presented with the developer's first application that application's image should be larger in size than the others.

When a user clicks on the titles of the applications, they are taken to that deployed application.

When a user resizes the page or views the site on various screens and devices they are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
